## Description

<br>

Natours is the final project of Jonas Schmedtmann's Udemy course, "**Node.js, Express, MongoDB & More: The Complete Bootcamp 2023**." Built with CSS, Express.js, JavaScript, a NoSQL database, and Pug Templates, Natours is a tour booking site that allows users to browse nature tours, "purchase" tours they wish to buy, view tours they've booked, update their login credentials/profile picture, and so much more!

<br>
